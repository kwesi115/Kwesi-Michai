        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                I’m a passionate web developer based in Chicago, IL, currently pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Economics at Howard University. At just 18 years old, I’ve already built a strong foundation in web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve expanded my expertise to frameworks and libraries such as Next.js, Node.js, React.js, and Angular. My skills also encompass backend development with Python and SQL, allowing me to tackle full-stack projects with confidence.
                
                One of my standout projects is a full-stack eCommerce platform built using the MERN stack, which highlights my ability to seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end development. My passion for continuous learning and innovation in the tech space drives me to consistently push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
                
                I’m eager to bring my technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and a strong work ethic to a dynamic team, making me a valuable addition to any company looking to leverage cutting-edge web technologies. My dedication to growth and excellence ensures that I’ll contribute effectively to any project, driving success and innovation.</p>
